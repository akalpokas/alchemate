def _run_somd2_workflow(
    context: SimulationContext, max_hard_restarts: int = 3, max_soft_restarts: int = 5
):
    """Internal function to run a SOMD2 workflow. Handles the isolated process running and queuing of child SOMD2 processes.

    Args:
        context : SimulationContext
            The simulation context containing the SOMD2 configuration, system, and other
            necessary parameters for running the workflow.
        max_hard_restarts : int, default=3
            Maximum number of hard restart attempts. Hard restarts run the workflow from
            scratch without attempting to resume from a previous state.
        max_soft_restarts : int, default=5
            Maximum number of soft restart attempts per hard restart cycle. Soft restarts
            attempt to resume the workflow from its last checkpoint or saved state.

    Notes:

        This function is designed to be resilient to SOMD2 failures by implementing both hard and soft restart strategies.
        Under the hood this happens:
        1. We enter a hard restart loop, where we will not attempt to restart a failed workflow, we will simply
        try to run it again from scratch.
        2. If a workflow fails for some reason, we will enter the soft restart loop, where we will attempt to
        restart the workflow. This is important in case we finished a substantial part of the workflow before the failure.
        3. If we exhaust all soft restart attempts, we will return to the hard restart loop.
        4. If we exhaust all hard restart attempts, we will give up and return an error.
        The function utilizes multiprocessing to run the SOMD2 workflow in an isolated process, allowing for better error handling and recovery.
