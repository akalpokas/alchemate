# Template class for all processing steps.
class WorkflowStep(ABC):
    """
    Base class for all workflow steps in a simulation workflow.

    This abstract class defines the interface and common behavior for workflow steps.
    Subclasses must implement the `_execute` method, which contains the main logic for the step.

    Methods
    -------
    run(context: SimulationContext)
        Executes the workflow step by calling the subclass-defined `_execute` method,
        and marks the step as completed in the provided context.

    _execute(context: SimulationContext)
        Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses. Contains the main logic for the workflow step.

    Attributes
    ----------
    None defined in the base class.
